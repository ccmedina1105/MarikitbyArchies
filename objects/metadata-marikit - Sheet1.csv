coll004,https://marikina.gov.ph/webmarikina/image/about.png,,,The Shoe Capital of the Philippines,Marikina City Government Official Website,1887,"The Augustinians were the first to arrive at the Marikina valley in 1500, at the spot known as ""chorillo"" in Barangka. Next came the Jesuits in 1630, in a place now called Jesus dela Peña (Jesus of the Rocks). Here, the Jesuits established a mission and built a chapel.In 1687, this pueblo became a parish known as Mariquina. In 1901, with the coming of the Americans,its name officially became Marikina. The early settlers lived along the riverbanks and nearby fertile farms. With the industry of the natives, combined with the know-how of the early Chinese settlers, the farms began to produce rice and vegetables in great quantities until the valley became part of the country's most prized hacienda.

By the 19th century, Hacienda Marikina had become the biggest in the country. For its size, natural beauty and plentiful harvest, the hacienda was declared a ""mayorazgo"" (Royal Estate) by the Spanish government. In the next century, to affirm the dignity of labor and enlist the cooperation of the workers, the Jesuits officially named the hacienda in honor of San Isidro labrador, the Patron of farmers.

By the turn of 20th century Marikina had become a town of shoemakers which started in 1887. Honed by years in shoe manufacturing, the natives had developed an industrial work ethic that prepared them for the arrival of heavy industries in the 1950's. With the industrial plants came waves of homelss families who started to occupy every available space. For the next three decades, Marikina would grow helter-skelter, a victim of runaway growth. Not until 1992 would it be able to turn a corner and reserved the trend under new leadership.

On 11 June 1901, Marikina was incorporated in the newly created Province of Rizal by Act. No. 137 of the Philippine Commission. In 1975, when the Metro Manila Commission was created under Presidential Decree No. 824, integrating four cities and 13 towns majority of which were in the province of Rizal, Marikina became part of Metropolitan Manila area.

Marikina soon became a victim of its own growth, creating a slew of problems. One of these was the deterioration of the Marikina River, which resulted from the reckless behavior of factories and squatter colonies that lined the banks.

Recovery and Renewal Marikina jumpstarted its efforts toward recovery and renewal in 1992. Guided by a vision of creating a modern and livable city, it has successfully laid the foundation of a flourishing community.

On December 8, 1996. Marikina was proclaimed a city through Republic Act 8223. Marikina has since transformed itself from a backward community into one that boasts thriving economy and hardworking, tenacious and disciplined citizens.

Today, Marikina is a multi-awarded city, often lauded for its vibrant business life, highly skilled workforce, and a responsive local government that puts a premium on governance, sustainable urban development and public service.",History,"Marikina City, Philiippines",4.6467479,121.07,"Heritage Page, Marikina City Government Official Website",,Image;StillImage,image/png,en,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/

In 1992 the residents organized and appointed an independent committee to take charge of finding a lot for their proposed chapel and the means for its construction. By 1996, the residents were on the way of realizing their dream with the donation by Noah's Paper Mills of a parcel of land on which to build the chapel. The deed of donation was turned over to the Diocese of Antipolo and the cornerstone of the envisioned St. Anthony de Padua Chapel was laid on April 19, 1996.

By January 1998, with the completion of the chapel, a brick, glass, and concrete structure that sits on a hill overlooking the Marikina River, the quasi parish of San Antonio de Padua was recognized.

Finally, on October 18, 2002 - a decade after the faithful had made the first move to build their chapel - the Quasi-Parish was established as the full-pledged Parish of San Antonio de Padua.",Architecture; Church; Religion,"Marikina City, Philiippines",4.6467479,121.07,"Heritage Page, Marikina City Government Official Website",,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,en,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/

Fernando. The museum was built with the aim of becoming an important venue for nurturing the historical values of the country’s shoe industry since Marikina is known as the Shoe Capital of the Philippines.

The building (built in the 1880s) had a significant role in the country’s history. Before it became a shoe museum, the building was used as an arsenal during the Spanish Period. It was also a detention cell during the Filipino-American War, where General Macario Sakay, one of the leaders of the Katipunan, was believed to have had been held as a prisoner. At the latter part of the American Regime, it was converted into a motor pool for the American soldiers.

After the Second World War, the Tuason family used the building as a rice mill for its entire hacienda in Marikina.

It currently houses the shoes of famous personalities, including pairs from former presidents of the Philippines, as well as those of former Mayors (and the current Mayor Marcy Teodoro) of Marikina, government officials and cabinet secretaries, celebrities, movie stars, ambassadors and well-known politicians including senators.

coll010,https://marikina.gov.ph/webmarikina/image/heritage/zamora-house.jpg,,,Zamora Ancestral House,Marikina City Government Official Website,1890,"The materials used to construct the house were said to come from drifting logs that were floating on the Marikina River from Rodriguez (formerly Montalban), Rizal. Indigenous tribes such as the Aetas used to gather wood from the river and sell it to the settlers. In 1890, Domingo Zamora (whose older brother Felipe Zamora was one of Dr. Jose Rizal’s co-propagandists in Madrid Spain) constructed a military headquarters and garrison in the guise of a residential house.

Domingo Zamora was the founder of the Iglesia Pilipina Independiente, whose origin was traced back to the struggle of the Filipino clergy against racial discrimination and friar domination within the Roman Catholic Church in the 19th Century. Eventually, the Iglesia Pilipina Independiente was turned into a nationalist crusade for the absolute Filipinization of the Church.

During the Second World War, Japanese soldiers used the house as their headquarters. The house survived the destruction and bombings during the Liberation of the American forces and was used as a relief center for the war victims, where rice and other staple food was distributed.

The ownership of the house was passed down to the side of Domingo Zamora’s wife who came from a family of physicians. The Santos family is the current residents of the house, of which a part is being used as a clinic.

Its architecture is an example of neo-classical “Bahay na Bato” with its use of pilaster, a classical architecture feature attached to the wall for decoration and support. Intricately designed carvings can be seen below the eaves of the roof. A notable feature of the house is the presence of a “tangka” or chimney at the back, considered revolutionary at that time. Its interiors are characterized by a high ceiling to allow natural ventilation.",Architecture,"J.P. Rizal Street, Sto.

Initial discussions delve with general remarks on industrial clusters and commodity chains with a detailed account of their internal structure and changing fortunes. The deeply-rooted failures of the cluster since the early 1990s are pinpointed. These can be directly related to the liberalization of the Filipino economy, and the concomitant increase in Chinese-made shoes on domestic markets. Various private and public responses to the crisis are described and evaluated. It is argued that as helpful as many of these responses may be, their overall impact is likely to remain limited.
